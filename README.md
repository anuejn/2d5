# Reverse engineering 5D mark II (5D2) image sensor

This repository contains notes tools for reverse engineering the image sensor of the Canon EOS 5D mark II
DSLR. The reverse engineering is work in progress and not in a state where the sensor is useable.
The image sensor is relatively cheap available (~40€) and has a "full frame" sized active area
(36mm × 24mm) with 5,616px × 3,744px (21.0 MP). The 5D mark II important in popularizing DSLR cameras
for video making and the Magic Lantern firmware was originally written for this camera.

The best place to start exploring the repository is reading the files on different topics in the
[`docs/`](docs/) directory. Other folders are less easy to follow but contain raw data obtained in 
the reverse engineering process.
