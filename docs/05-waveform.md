# Waveform of the image sensor

The image sensor consists of 3 main time periods. We decide that we base all our math off the middle
one, A line period. A line period starts at a rising edge of J21.

Signals to investigate:
* How does J10 actually look??? -> like in the newer la trace
* Is C3 having a signal? (line) -> yes
* Is C6 having a signal? (line) -> yes
* Is C5 having a signal? (frame) -> no
